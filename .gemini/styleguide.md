This repository is for open-source fintech projects with public Github, Gitlab, SourceHut, etc links.
Links should be accessible by anyone (not 404, no private repos, no SaaS-only landing pages, no dead projects).

- For each entry: [Project Name](https://github.com/owner/repo) – One short sentence describing what it does and why it's useful in fintech. (Add main language if helpful, e.g., Go, JS, Python.)

- Keep descriptions very concise (10–30 words).
- Keep new entries to categories already in use by the README.md

Review the submission and offer helpful guidance (alphabetize entries, clear and short sentences) on each pull request.
